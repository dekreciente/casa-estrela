            <strong>A BIT OF THE STORY</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="located-text">
            Casa Estrela was a family house built in the late 50s over a public fountain (which still exists under its structure). Three generations of the same family lived in this house simultaneously, and they kept a grocery shop on the ground floor. This shop sold a bit of everything. From coffee, rice, sugar, olive oil, to fabrics, clothes, haberdashery, stationery, etc. They had a telephone and later also a TV in the store, which was very important as there were only two/three in the whole village and the others were private. The store was a very crucial meeting point in the village, and it still is open nowadays. Since 1999, it has been managed by Bernardino ( or should I just say another person from the village or erase this sentence). Casa Estrela was/is? the name of the grocery shop, and since people knew the house by this name, we decided to keep it also for this project.

            If you're interested in knowing more about the history of the house, the shop, and the other businesses happening around it, here is the translated letter from the youngest resident at that time and nowadays the owner of the house.
        </p>

        <p class="located-text">
            The house had been uninhabited since 2011, when, in August 2023, we made a loaning contract with the owner and started a series of renovations with the idea of turning it into a space for collective living. Since then, We have been building this space to develop projects, crafts, research or practices and collaborate, support, and share with each other. But besides hosting people, the project aims to work intergenerationally with the inhabitants of the village and its suroundings. We are committed to organising a cultural program, with workshops, activities and events open to the community and the guests are expected to contribute to it.
        </p>

        <p class="located-text">
            We want to collectively develop this project, we welcome any suggestions or improvements that can help shape its future. So feel free to email us to talk about it.
