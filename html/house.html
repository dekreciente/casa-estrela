            <p class="staywithus-text">The house is not barrier-free and doesn't meet accessibility standards for wheel-chairs. We are actively working on solutions to improve accessibility and make the space more inclusive. If you have any questions, need more information, or have suggestions on how we can enhance accessibility, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.</p>

            <p class="staywithus-text">There are three cats living in the house, and that's why we are not able to have other animals. Also, take into consideration that if you suffer from allergies to cats, the house is not the ideal place for you. </p>

            <p class="staywithus-text">MASSIA is an easily accessible and self-organised space. It has no selection process, it is relatively cheap, its doors are open. Note that the house is not huge, and to be able to function properly, we need to respect all the areas, as well as everyone's schedules. It's also important to note that since we practice community living, everyday tasks like maintaining the house clean and weekly tasks like cleaning will be performed by everyone living in the house at that moment. </p>
            <p class="staywithus-text">Whatever project you are working on, we can only make it possible for you if you make it possible for everyone too. The things in MASSIA are there for you and you are there for the things as well.</p>
            <p class="staywithus-text">MASSIA aspires to be a space where intersectional, anti-racist, feminist analysis inform practice. Sexism, racism, classism, LGBTQ+phobia, ableism, ageism and any other form of discrimination or aggression are not tolerated. MASSIA fosters a practice of collective accountability and considers it everybody's responsibility.</p>
